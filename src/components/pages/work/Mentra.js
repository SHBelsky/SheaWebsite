                I am the Tech Lead for Mentra's engineering team, whose goal is to create a hiring platform for people with autism. By 2025, Mentra aims to have employ 100,000 talented autistic individuals! As Tech lead, I work with leadership, experience design, and QA to develop, plan, and execute an engineering roadmap to onboard candidates and recruiters to our platform.
