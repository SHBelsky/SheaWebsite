                    I am a member of the Stores and Geos team, which maintains and improves upon the experiences for Wayfair's Specialty Retail Brands and International stores. I work with different teams from across Wayfair in order to tailor each part of Wayfair's platform to the unique needs and expectations of each store. I collaborate heavily with product managers, experience designers & researchers, business intelligence, analytics, and QA to develop and execute upon projects that are specific to Wayfair's broad range of stores.

                    I am an engineer on the Home Services Attached team, connecting Wayfair customers with assembly, installation, and warranty offerings. I work with product managers, experience designers, business intelligence, and web analysts to drive the growth and development of Home Services offerings and products.
