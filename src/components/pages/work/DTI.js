            <h2>Lead Instructor and Creator of "Trends in Web Development"</h2>
            <h3>April - December 2018</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.cornelldti.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cornell Design & Tech Initiative</a> is a project team of students from across Cornell Universisty's campus who are passionate about community impact through technology. <a href="https://github.com/cornell-dti/webdev-class-fall2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trends in Web Development</a> is a student-led course in the Department of Information Science, teaching the concepts, technologies, frameworks, and best practices used in the industry for web development. This course is complementary to existing course offerings in web development, focusing on applying knowledge and theory that students will have learned in other courses. I am the creator and lead instructor for this course, having developed the curriculum, lecture material, course structure, and assignments.. I worked with Cornell administration and faculty in order to reserve a classroom, list the course on Cornell's online course roster. Course topics include front-end development with React and Webpack, back-end development with Node.js and Express, full-stack application development, cloud-hosting with Heroku, and more.

                As Developer Lead, I was responsible for interviewing and onboarding new members, supporting projects with feature development and bug fixing, and mentoring members across all teams and specialties. As a team lead, I also worked with other team leads to coordinate recruitment and events for the project team, work with members of the Cornell community on problems and areas of improvement, and plan the long-term future of the team.
