            <h2>User Experience Engineering Intern</h2>
            <h3>May - August 2018</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with Google's Search and Assistant team during the Summer of 2018 as a User Experience Engineering Intern. I was a member of the sumUX team, in Google's Mountain View campus. I worked on prototypes for Google's Search and Assistant products, developed internal tools to aid User Experience Designers and Engineers with prototype ideation and exploration, and aided User Experience Researchers with conducting and understanding the results of research.
