                <a href="http://slopeday.cornell.edu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Slope Day</a> is Cornell University's largest music event, attended by thousands of people. As the Recruitment Director, I redesigned the Slope Day website with new branding, information, and flavor. I also distributed advertisements to the Cornell student body, organized general body committees to participate in, and managed our email list.

            <p>
                As the Volunteer Director, I was in charge of volunteers for Slope Day festival, including Cornell students, faculty, and staff. Leading up to the event, I advertise Slope Day to members of the Cornell community, and assign volunteers to times based on availability and when they are needed. I recruited volunteers and coordinated their duties, met with other volunteer leads, and planned the logistics and schedule of the day's events with the rest of the Slope Day Programming Board.
