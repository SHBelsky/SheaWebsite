            <p>
                <a href="https://bigredhacks.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Big Red Hacks</a> is Cornell University's first hackathon. As the Web Team Lead, I work with other team members to plan and implement essential functionality and software for our website. I am also the first point of contact to address issues that are identified on GitHub and in Slack. On the day of the event, I support hackers and event logistics by resolving any critical website errors.
