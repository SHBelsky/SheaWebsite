            <p>
                <a href="https://bigredhacks.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Big Red Hacks</a> is Cornell University's largest hackathon. As the Web Team Lead, I work with other team members to plan and implement essential functionality and software for our website. I am also the first point of contact to address issues that are identified on GitHub and in Slack. On the day of the event, I support hackers and event logistics by resolving any critical website errors.

            <h2>Volunteer Coordinator</h2>
            <h3>May 2016 - December 2018</h3>
            <p>
                As the Volunteer Coordinator, I am in charge of recruiting, training, and maintaining over 150 volunteers. Leading up to the event, I advertise BigRed//Hacks to members of the Alpha Phi Omega community service organization, and assign members to times based on availability and when they are needed. During the event, I am responsible for assigning them tasks throughout the weekend-long event, including setting up Cornell's Physical Sciences Building for a hackathon, distributing food and event giveaways, aiding hackathon sponsors with their booths, ushering hackers to events around campus, and cleaning up the event space.
